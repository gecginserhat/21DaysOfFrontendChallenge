Day 1: Mastering HTML - The Building Blocks of the Web <br/>


🎯 Hello everyone, I decided to do a 21-day Frontend development challenge to improve myself even more. Since I have a background in Software, I would like to state that I will go through some topics quickly. I wanted to share this journey with you. Maybe you will join me. I am progressing through the Udemy series prepared by Mustafa Murat Coşkun and Engin Demiroğ in this series. <br/>

-HTML & Developer Console: Understanding the basics and using the console to debug. <br/>
-First Web Page & Layout: Created my first webpage and set up the basic layout. <br/>
-Meta Tags & Comments: Added meta information and comments for clarity. <br/>
-Headings & Paragraphs: Worked with <h1> to <h6> and <p> tags.<br/>
-HTML5 Styling: Applied basic styling with HTML5 tags.<br/>
-Formatting Tags: Used tags like <strong>, <em>, and more.<br/>
